# NLP-utils
Efficient implementation of commonly used NLP operations. 

Major work would be to create a common wrapper for diferent NLP libraries (CoreNLP, openNLP, NLTK, Spacy, GATE etc.) based on which library has efficient implementation of particular NLP operation. 

Goal is to avoid confusion related to which NLP library to use for a particular task.
